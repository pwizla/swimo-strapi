A rewrite of my previous [Swimo](https://github.com/pwizla/swimo) project with [Strapi](https://strapi.io) as a backend.

***

To install and start the application, please run the following commands:

1. `cd backend && yarn && yarn develop` to install dependencies for the Strapi backend server and start it
2. `cd ../frontend && yarn && yarn start` to install dependencies for the React frontend and start the server

Strapi's admin panel is accessible at `[host]:1337/admin` and the front end SPA is accessible at `[host]:3000`.
